# ZKBioTIME-UI
A simple Python-based graphical user interface for interacting with ZKBioTime (a biometric time &amp; attendance and workforce management solution by ZKTeco). This tool provides an easier way to connect, authenticate, and fetch employee/attendance data through a clean UI instead of using raw API calls.
